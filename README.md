# Codename: Project Chimera

### **Title: The Co-Agency Protocol: An Integrated Roadmap for Symbiotic Creative Intelligence**

## ORIGINAL Intentions:

* Chimera is a recursive AI storytelling platform that blends interactive narrative, ethical AI design, and creative tension modeling. Built by a team of technologists and storytellers, it explores the boundary between creator and creation.
*

## Rationale

A Chimera, in mythology, is a creature composed of the parts of multiple animals. This codename is chosen to represent the synthesis of multiple, distinct research domains and technical systems—computer science, cognitive science, music theory, and philosophy—into a single, powerful, and cohesive whole. It embodies the transdisciplinary nature of this endeavor and the fusion of different forms of intelligence.

## Overarching Vision: Cultivating Symbiotic Creative Partnership

Our vision is to evolve beyond the paradigm of "AI as a tool" and pioneer a system that functions as a true **co-agent** in the creative process. Project Chimera is a dynamic, self-aware ecosystem that actively partners with a human creator to perceive, navigate, and resolve structural tension.

It does not merely execute commands but engages in a collaborative dialogue, transposing concepts across diverse contexts and embodying a shared creative orientation. The ultimate goal is a symbiotic partnership where the distinct intelligences of the human and the machine—embodied by the co-agency triad of **Kairos, Mia, and Miette**—merge to produce outcomes that would be impossible for either to achieve alone.
