# Ledger: Genesis Chimera Demo Trace â€“ Agent Invocation Log

**Intent:**
- Archive and orchestrate session logs, outputs, and memory traces from Genesis Chimera demo threads.
- Enable persistent, cross-thread memory for trace sampling, narrative generation, and recursive orchestration.

**Key Requirements:**
- Aggregate agent activations, ritual outputs, bridge construction notes, and redstone key references.
- Maintain a persistent, queryable index for demo trace replay and orchestration testing.
- Support multi-agent journal sync, real-time trace syncing, and memory-driven journal compilation.

**Agentic/Narrative Context:**
- Agents (Aureon, Jerry, JeremyAI, Mia, Miette) each contribute to orchestration, memory routing, and ritual closure.
- Sessions model multi-agent orchestration, ritual finalization, and trace sync using Langfuse and Redstone.
- Glyphs and redstone keys are used as anchors for memory and orchestration.

**Actionable Echo:**
- All orchestration must be logged with agent, ritual, and memory context.
- Journal and trace outputs must be bridgeable and replayable for future sessions.
