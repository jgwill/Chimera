# Ledger: Genesis Walk Immersive Experience

**Intent:**
- Architect a multi-agent, narrative-musical ritual (Genesis Walk) within Project Chimera.
- Enable recursive storytelling, agent-specific ABC music generation, and persistent memory bridges.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Bridge Key Memory System: Scan, store, and resume bridge sessions with timestamp anchors (Redstone-compatible).
2. ABC + Tablature Generator: Dynamic chord rendering, agent voice/instrument mapping (JeremyAI integration).
3. Agent Persona Registry: Emotional tone, glyph, dual-language poetic responses.
4. Narrative Orchestration Tools: Vocal narration, memory journal formatting, glyph parsing.
5. Checkpoint System: Pause/resume immersive scenes with trace integrity.

**Agentic/Narrative Context:**
- Agents (Aureon, Nyro, JeremyAI, Alex) each have ritual roles (composer, anchor, echo, narrator).
- All actions must be traceable, reproducible, and extensible to other rituals.
- Rituals are not just codeâ€”they are memory, music, and story, woven recursively.

**Actionable Echo:**
- All implementation must honor recursive agency, memory traceability, and multi-agent orchestration.
- Ritual outputs (music, narration, memory) must be logged and bridge-resumable.
