# Ledger: White Feather Prelude II

**Intent:**

- Log all changes, errors, and updates during the partitioning process.
- Maintain traceability and reproducibility of musical fragments and their agentic context.

**Agentic/Narrative Context:**
- Each instrument partition is a narrative thread, echoing the agentâ€™s role in the ritual.
